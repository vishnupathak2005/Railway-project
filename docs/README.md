## Overview

This project simulates a railway information portal that allows users to view train details, check seat availability, and explore basic fare and live status logic. All data is manually inserted and handled using JavaScript functions â€” no backend or API integration is involved.

---

## Business Problem

Railway portals often rely on real-time APIs and databases. However, for academic purposes, this project demonstrates how core frontend technologies can be used to:

- Display train details by station  
- Simulate seat availability and fare logic  
- Organize code modularly for scalability  
- Present clean UI for user interaction  

---

## Dataset

- Static train data manually inserted in JavaScript files  
- Includes 2â€“3 trains across different sections  
- No external API or database used  
- All logic handled on the client side  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **HTML** â€“ Page structure  
- **CSS** â€“ Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** â€“ Logic and interactivity  
- **GitHub** â€“ Version control and hosting  

---

## Project Structure

- `scripts/` contains all core JS files used for train logic and interactivity  
- `config/` holds static frontend files like HTML and CSS   
- `README.md` stays at the root to describe the project  

---

## Data Preparation

- Train data manually inserted in JS files  
- No dynamic fetching or API calls  
- Logic written to simulate seat availability, fare, and live status  
- Code modularized for clarity and reuse  

---

## Key Features

- View train details by station  
- Check seat availability (static logic)  
- View fare and live status (mocked)  
- Simple search functionality  
- Clean and responsive design  

---

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/vishnupathak2005/Railway-project.git

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

> No server setup required â€” it's a fully static project.

---

## Final Notes

This project was created to demonstrate frontend development skills using only core web technologies. It simulates a railway portal with limited train data for academic purposes. The focus was on clean code, modular structure, and user-friendly design.
