# Railway Information Portal

This is a simple railway information portal built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was developed as part of my **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** final year project. The application displays train-related data without using any external APIs — all data is manually inserted for demonstration purposes.
